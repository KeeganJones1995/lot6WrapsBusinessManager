Created With QT Creator under Open Source Licensing Agreement, as well as SQLite3
A program designed to keep track of current and past jobs, and inventory for my friends vinyl wrapping business.
This application allows the user to add, view, and update clients, their vehicles, job, and assets, through an easily manouverable UI.
This application also allows the user to use other features such as searching, and printing of receipts.
This application has not yet been distributed, and if/when it is distributed it will be as a gift for a good friend of mine who is starting his own vinyl wrapping business out of his garage.
There is an accompanying error log, for any major problems I encountered up to this point.
This is a fully functioning application, however the following things still need to be done:
  1)Update UI to be more user friendly and more in tune with what the primary user(Zachary Fronchack) wants
  2)Re-do how the assets are stored, since there is currently not a good way to distinguish how much of each wrap is used for each job
  3)Learn and use a library which will allow the application to create nice official PDF receipts which the user can than print out
  4)Add a add staff member feature, as well as implement a hierarchy system for employees, which will allow certain employees to access certain features but not others
In the screen shots folder there is a few screenshots of various aspects of the program
A sample insert script which will serve as the databade schema has also been provided
